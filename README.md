# Genysis
A PWA based on Library Genesis, with clean interface, direct download, inbuilt **[EXPERIMENTAL]** reader support (epub) and send to mail feature.

**⚠ This project was meant to be a playground for testing out PWA™| Serviceworkers™ | Workbox™ | Indexdb™ and in no way is meant to be a fully functional *usable* app.**

*⚠ Send to mail might not work if downloading the ebook takes >10s which is the function execution time limit for [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/platform/limits#serverless-function-execution-timeout)*
